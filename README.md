# odin-recipes
I created a website that lets you take a look at three recipes that I have created. One being Enchiladas, another being Green Eggs and Hame and the last one being Teriyaki chicken. When you go into the website, It has those 3 dishes listed as links. I created an html template for each on of them. In the templated I added headers(h1,h2,h3 ect), along with a title for the website. As well as creating links for each one of the dishes, utilizing the unordered list along with ordered list for the steps on how to make each dish. In addition to that I also added images, using img src, I also insured the links would not open within the same page and they would open up a new tab. By using the target and rel , furthmore I also use alt to describe the image in case the image wasnt displayed or for anyone impaired.
